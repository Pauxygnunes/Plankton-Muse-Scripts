% The script "parttable" is designed to assist the composition of Jonas
% Hocherman's "Plankton Muse", for Big Band. This piece is based on the
% sonification of data representing the dynamical growth of phytoplankton
% in the Baltic Sea during the year 2024. The data was captured by the
% Finnish Environment Institute (SYKE) and shared with the author for
% artistic purposes. The resultant table is composed by nine columns, being
% the last eight the partitions to be applied in the composition,
% calculated from the data of plankton growth and converted in instrumental
% parts. The first column gives the number of ocurrences of the partition
% in the given range. This information can help the composer to choose more
% appropriate partitions for each section of the word.
